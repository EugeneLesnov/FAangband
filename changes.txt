Welcome to the changelog for FAangband. This file tracks the changes made since
1.4.4.

FAangband 2.0.1
===============

This version mainly fixes bugs and corrects balance from version 2.0.1.

FAangband 2.0.0
===============

This version is an attempt to rebuild FAangband 1.4.4 (FA) on top of latest Angband (V).

There are a great many changes both from V and from FA, so I'm not going to list all of them.  Some obvious points:

 - V's 4.2 classes are used, so the same as old FA classes except that Assassins have been replaced with Blackguards, and the spell lists are very different.

 - The monster list is a fusion of the V and FA lists.

 - Combat is closely based on FA.

 - Ego items (including jewellery) and artifacts are straight from FA, but other objects are mostly as in V.
