=================== "Map" of Middle Earth =======================

There are four maps you can choose when beginning a game of FAangband.  The 
standard wilderness, extended wilderness and hybrid dungeon basically use the 
map below (although in the case of the hybrid dungeon, travel between dungeons 
is via portal).  The Angband dungeon map uses a standard Angband model, where 
the player starts in town, and there is dungeon immediately below.

Below is a rough diagram of the linkages between the regions of Middle
Earth which your character can visit.  Dungeons are shown in brackets under
the region where their entrance lies (Nan Dungortheb is not strictly a dungeon,
but acts like one in some ways).  Some towns are clearly marked; for the
others and for a description of towns, see "town.txt".  For more information
about wilderness and dungeons, see "wild-dun.txt".  Note that the routes
marked with *s are only available in the compressed_map (default) option.
