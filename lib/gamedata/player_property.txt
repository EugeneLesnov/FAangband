# Descriptions and messages can be edited without bad effects.
# Changing code may have unpredictable results.
# Changing the name, reordering, or adding whole new entires will severely
# disrupt the game, and should only be done when the associated list-*.h
# files (and other code) are also  being changed, and the game recompiled.

# code - the effect name used by the game. Element codes are templates, and
#        one is made for each element
